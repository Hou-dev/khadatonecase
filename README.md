## What is the Khadas Tone Board?
Khadas is a Digital to Analog convert that converts a digital signal to analog singal. For PCs it converts our digital singal of 1s and 0s to and analog which a speaker system or headphones could understand.
## Why would you use such a device?
Audio on lower end motherboards has been known in the past for being riddled with distortion and interference. For the best audio experience a device like the Khadas Tone Board is reccomened. The fine people over at AudioScience forum has compiled a list of measurements and reviews. They will do a better job at explain this subject in depth.

## Khadas Enclosure
The Khadas tone board is sold on Amazon as a PCB and without a case. This put me on a journey to learn to make a 3D model for the device.
Using Fusion360 I was able to model a case for the Tone Board.
